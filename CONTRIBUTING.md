# Contributing Guidelines

## General Remarks

This project serves as a template for implementing the InnerSource Commons [InnerSource Portal](https://patterns.innersourcecommons.org/p/innersource-portal) pattern.
Any change to improve and advance the portal is welcome. Please note that the portal should be able to display any kind of InnerSource project at any company applying [InnerSource principles](https://innersourcecommons.org/resources/books/adoptinginnersource/).
Changes should be made in a generic and extensible way, so that all stakeholders can benefit from the improvement and apply it to their portal instance.

## Found a bug?

Just open an issue, describe how to reproduce the bug and what you would expect instead. We will get back to you soon.

## Contributing Code

1. Make sure the change is welcome (see [General Remarks](#general-remarks)). When in doubt open an issue first or start a discussion with the project team

2. Create a branch by forking this repository and apply your change.

3. Commit and push your change(s) on that branch and create a pull request once your code is ready.

4. Wait for our code review and approval, possibly enhancing your change on request.

5. Once the change has been approved and merged, we will inform you in a comment.

## Contributing a crawler

Have a look at the [reference implementations](docs/CRAWLING.md#reference-implementations) for crawling the InnerSource repositories and check if one of the existing solutions works well for you.
If you are using a different programming language or source code management system you can implement your own crawler and list it there for others to use.

## Contributing by adding Adopters

If your organization is using this project, or have used it as a reference, consider adding it as an _adopter_.  
Follow the instructions on the file [ADOPTERS.md](./ADOPTERS.md).

## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

Due to legal reasons, contributors will be asked to accept a DCO before they submit the first pull request to this projects, this happens in an automated fashion during the submission process. SAP uses [the standard DCO text of the Linux Foundation](https://developercertificate.org/).
