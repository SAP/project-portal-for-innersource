## How to update the Adopters list

If you would like to add an organization, check our [contribution guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md) and send us a pull request (preferred). Alternatively create an issue with the required information:

* **Organization:** Name and link to the organization
* **Details:** Whatever you want to share with respect to how it is being used
* **References:** Any publicly available references where it is stated that the portal is used, was used, or used as a reference, by the organization

If you want to add more details, and that does not fit in the table, add a sub-heading for the organization just below the table.

When sending a pull request, keep the table in alphabetical order.
